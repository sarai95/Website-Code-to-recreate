        <h2>Wright Residence</h2>
        <p>
          This design was for the home of a local business owner.  After building and designing his own landscape a few times he and his wife asked for my help in putting together something
          different.  They wanted a layout that was unique from the rest of their subdivision and that was exciting and dynamic.  After showing them a few different ideas, they decided
          that they liked the bold lines of concentric circles.  They love wildflowers and wanted planting beds full of perennials which require relatively low 
          maintenance.  They wanted to have raised garden beds that were far from their entertaining area.  With two kids and another on the way, play area outside was important to them, and they
          wanted a separated place for a swingset and a sunken trampoline.  To go along with the woodsy wildflower look they also wanted a secluded fire pit area which was screened from 
          the rest of the yard.  This family loves being outside and playing sports together so a large grass area was also a must for them.

        <h2>Dynascape NCLC event</h2>
        <p>
          I took second place in the National Collegiate Landscape Competition with this design.  In the three months I had to prepare for the competition I learned DynaScape on my own time.
          At the competition I was given a small paper base map and client needs the afternoon before the event, then the next day I had two hours in the lab to create it. 
          <br>The site was very small and the client wanted to maximize their entertaining space with a modern outdoor kitchen, dining area, and a firepit with built in seating.  Privacy
          was also a big concern and due to HOA regulations they could not use privacy fences.  I used a modified diagonal to best utelize the limited space and dense plantings of shrubs and evergreeens for screening.
          A spiral staircase grants access to a second floor balcony which was previously inaccessable.  There are walkways on either side which connect the back yard to the front of the house and expanding the space to the 
          side yard.

          This is a project done in class for a client.  We went to the site as individual groups to take measurements and meet with the client to talk about their needs
          and wants.  Mrs.Johnson and her family love flowers and wnated lots of color in their yard.  They have seven young children so they also needed space for them to 
          play outdoors safely.  A unique desire of the family was to have a pond where they could swim in the summertime.  They have many existing trees that we incorporated
          into planting beds to take them out of the grass area.

        <h2>Rec Center Lodge Concept Design</h2>
        <p>
          Brigham Young University Idaho is considering adding an outdoor recreational center to their campus to create a separated space where students can go to 
          enjoy nature and participate in outdoor activities.  Some of the activities being considered are a skiing, tubing, and sledding hill; a water slide; a 
          lake which can be used for ice skating in the winter; a lodge for large gatherings and theraputic yoga; hiking trails; campsites; firepits; and an 
          ampitheatre.  The entire area of the proposed site is about 36 acres and is located on a naturally terraced hill.  The first level is where the lodge is 
          to be situated overlooking the rest of the site.  
        </p>
        <p>
          My group chose to work on the lodge area.  For this area we needed to put together a concept design for the lodge itself which could comfortably 
          accomodate 200 people, a 14,000 square foot grass area, and a main parking lot for the entire site.  They asked that the lodge have a large gathering
          room which could be split into two rooms with lots of windows facing west to watch the sunset.  It needed to be screened from an apartment complex and 
          main road to the East along with a church building to the North.  They wanted the site to feel like a secluded woodland paradise.  
        </p>
        <p>
          We did some research to come up with a basic concept for the lodge and decided to include a wrap around deck that would extend out over the edge of the 
          hill.  The front of the deck sits at ground level to provide easy access to wheelchairs and extend accessibility to everyone.  As you walk around the
          deck, the ground drops out from under it leaving you with a beautiful view over the hillside when you reach the back.  We chose to have the lodge face
          East so that we could create a nice entryway and frame a view to the West as you walk in.  The entire West wall of the building is filled with windows
          to allow natural lighting and a view of the sunset.  Native planting in the front creates a feeling of being in the woods, and the lodge is framed
          by both fast growing quaking aspens, and slower growing limber pines.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grass area is just over 14,000 square feet and is surrounded by more native plants such as aspens, maples and birches.  To the north we had some 
          space that we wanted to utelize so we created a separated gravel area which can be used for smaller gatherings and fires.  We included a stream 
          surrounding the area to provide sound screening and  bring a fun element of surprise to the space.

          I was given a base map and a client needs analysis. The clients have recently become empty nesters and have decided to build a home with
            their extra income.  They  would like it to be a place where their children and grandchildren can gather for family reunions.  I chose to offset the main entryway path to create 
            interest define a transition zone near the door.  There is a sitting area near the front door to entertain small parties on warm days.  The 
            front path connects to a separate writing area to the East.  This area is made private by the raised planter that divides it from the front 
            yard, along with a pergola structure.  It also has an herb garden and small walking path to connect to the back door as well as create a more natural 
            feel for the space.  The backyard is connected to the front yard by the large lawn area that provides space for grandchildren to play.  In 
            the back is a bigger patio, with a water feature where large parties can gather.  There is a fireplace where the clients can watch the sunset, along with a grill area, and a secluded porch swing.  The back yard is screened from the neighbors by a mix of evergreens and flowering trees which then leads into an 
            orchard.  
            <br> I 3D rendered the back patio in VizTerra.

        <h2>Hort 230 Midterm Project</h2>

        <p>
          This project is based on my design professor's dream backyard.  I interviewed him and his wife as clients to gather information on their needs and preferences.
          They wanted a raised outdoor patio and a firepit area that was connected to my professor's design studio across the yard.  They have three kids and a dog so they wanted
          an outdoor play area that could be seen from the kitchen windows (right set) and a reduced amount of grass to reduce maintenance. The patio area is raised to match the 
          level of the house doors with steps down to a ground level pathway and a sunken fireplace area.  All of the planting is at ground level.  I kept the
          play area in its original location along with the existing tree shading it, and enlarged and defined it with wood chips to eliminate the need to mow and
          edge around the playground equipment. There is a path lined with plants and trees which leads from the main patio to the design studio.  The walkway between the grass spaces is wide enough for the mower to pass through without harming the plants.  Outside the studio is a small
          patio where my professor can put a two person table so he can work outside on nice days.  In front of the design studio is a planting bed, with an access 
          path, filled with ornamental plants that is situated right outside the studio window.  On the left I also kept the original orchard and supplimented it
          with additional trees to fill in the empty space.  I replaced the grass underneath with mulch to protect the trees from lawn equipment and cut down 
          on the time spent mowing.  I expanded the existing storage shed and added large double doors to allow easier access inside.

        <h2>Hort 230 Atrium Design</h2>
        <p>
          This project was for an atrium in a school with classrooms and a foyer looking in on all sides.  This space had no ceiling
          and should be an escape from the classroom.  There needed to be a place for a statue, a water feature, and an area where
          class could be held outdoors.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose the concentric circle style because it naturally lends itself to an expanding seating area. Placing the speaking area offcenter
          gave me more space for seating and planting.  It also naturally leads bypassers through the back of the ampitheatre quietly without
          having to disrupt the presentation while still allowing them to enjoy the area.  This style also created an excellent space centered at the back for the statue with space for benches.  The raised planters in the back create the feel of an ampitheatre and provide extra seating around the statue.

        <h2>Hort 230 Planting Designs</h2>
        <p>
          This exercise was a focus on planting design.  I created a backdrop for the patio and fireplace area using a mix of deciduous and 
          evergreen trees.  I also softened the transition and created a variety of height by adding shrubs and low planting underneath the trees.
          There is a focal tree near the water feature to help create an even more interesting space.  Near the edges of the
          hardscape is annual plantings to bring color into the space.
