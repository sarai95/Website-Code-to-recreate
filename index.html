        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Sara Shirley</h3>
        <p>
          I am a Horticulture major and Senior at Brigham Young University-Idaho. I grew up on a small farm in Idaho where my parents taught me the meaning of hard work.
          I love learning about plants and have taken both woody plant ID and herbaceous plant ID classes.  
          My husband and I were married in March of 2018 and now live in Idaho with our pet bunny while I finish school.                    
          I have a passion for reading, drawing, sewing, and wood crafts, and I have recently been experimenting with painting as well.            
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning is something that is important to me, which is one of the reasons I love design work because it tests my creativity
          and pushes me to grow in knowledge and skill.  I am proficient at hand rendering and am familliar with design programs such as AutoCAD, DynaSCAPE, and VizTerra.  I love the challenge of creating functional landscapes that are beautiful and sustainable.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          It is my dream to work for an established landscape company as a designer doing high end residential designs, though I am open to doing
          commercial design work as well.  I love the idea of sustainable design and hope to be able
          to learn more about concepts such as working with local materials and creating wildlife habitats, in order to incorporate
          them into my designs.  Working with edible plants is also an interest of mine, and I am currently 
          learning how to "paint" with what are commonly considered only garden plants that are normally shoved to the back corner and use them to
          their full potential in a landscape.
