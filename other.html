        <h2>2017 Pergola</h2>
        <p>
        Hort 252 Landscape Construction. In this class we demolished an existing pergola that had degraded to become a safety hazard
          and replaced it.  We used an interlocking wall system and pavers donated by Belgard. I learned about proper foundation preparation
          as well as paver laying techniques.  I was also introduced to different types of machinery including a skid steer, backhoe, dingo,
          and a plate compactor.  This was a semester long project that taught me many basic construction skills.

        <h2>2018 Spirit Garden Renovation</h2>
        <p>
          Hort 453 Landscape Construction Materials.  In this class we completed a number of projects including the creation of a new planting bed and pathway, repairing a fountain retaining wall, re-setting overturning stairs,
          and creating a Japanese stooping basin.  I was able to use equipment that I had used to previously like the dingo, and was
          introduced to new equipmenmt such as a telehandler and a cut-away saw.  Each of these projects taught me different skills such as placing
          boulders and fixing existing structures without damaging them.  The outdoor portion comprised the first half of the semester while the 
          second half was focused on specific areas such as water feature design and specs, irrigation troubleshooting, landscape lighting design, and wood construction.

          <h2>Woody ID Area Study</h2>
          <h3>Trees of Michigan</h3>
          <p>
             This is my final research project for my Woody ID class.  I gathered information about plants that grow in the Michigan area and compiled it into a binder with sections on: 
            <ul>
              <li>Fall Color</li>
              <li>Spring Flower</li>
              <li>Summer Flower</li>
              <li>Winter Bark</li>
              <li>Street Trees</li>
          </ul>
            I chose the Eastern area of Michigan which is mostly a zone 6 with patches of zone 5.  This area intrested me because of the humid climate from the Great Lakes.
